This is the start of something new,
A melody just for you.

Chorus: 
Sing it loud, sing it bright,
Feel the rhythm through the night.
Let the music take control,
Fill your heart and free your soul.

Verse 2: 
The journey starts, we take our flight,
Through the dark and into light.

Bridge: 
Oh, the echoes call our names,
Through the fire and through the flames.

Outro: 
Hold on tight, don't let go,
Ride the wave, let it flow.
Memories made in the sound,
Forever here, forever found. IsDeleted:false ReleaseDate:2025-02-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC CreatedAt:0001-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC}
